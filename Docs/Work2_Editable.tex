Figure \ref{fig:DE_HubbleDistance2_Sync} shows several ratios of the Hubble distance.
 
 
Figure \ref{fig:GrowthFunction_Sync} and figure \ref{fig:GrowthFunction_Sync2} are the growth functions.

Figure \ref{fig:PowerSpectrum_Sync} is the power spectra.

Figure \ref{fig:DE_Qfac_Sync} shows the normalization factors, which are defined as 
\begin{equation}
Q^2=\frac{\text{Power spectra of DE model with EoS w}}{\text{Power spectra of LCDM model}}, \text{at some wavenumber $k$.}
\end{equation}


\newpage    %It is weird that this command solve the problem that the figure goes between the double line and the text.
