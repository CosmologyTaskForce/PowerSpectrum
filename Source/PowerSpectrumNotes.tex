\subsubsection{To Think More}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
A little dimensional analysis is shown here, in case of future mistakes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Hubble constant, $H_0$ carries the dimension of $[Time]^{-1}$
\item
Gravitational constant, $G$ carries the dimension of $[Length]^3/[Mass][Time]^2$
\item
Speed of light in vacuum, $c$ of course, has the dimension of $[Length]/[Time]$

\end{enumerate}


\item
Large $k$ corresponds to the future. Besides, large $k$ should have the same amplitude because they have not come inside the horizon.

\item
What's more, the comoving horizon becomes constant in the far future.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

\end{figure}

This simply means there are perturbations that will never come into the horizon.

To calculate the power spectrum, one should cut the growth functions at $z=0$ and set the matter perturbation the same then calculate on. Since these are outside of the horizon, today's power spectrum seems weird.

\item
The power spectrum calculated by me is the power of today. However, observations certainly won't get the power spectrum of the present day. On large scales, the distribution of matter is the in the state of earlier ages.

In paper {\bf Matter power spectrum from the Lyman-alpha forest: myth or reality?} ({\it Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 334, 107-116, 2002}) calculated the distribution of matter at $z=2.72$. This paper also assumed that the underlying baryon density follows that of dark matter (their reference is Croft et al, 2001, astro-ph/0012324).

\section{Todo List}
\begin{itemize}
\item
\sout{Find all the growth factors if they are useful.}
\item
\sout{Calculate the fiducial power spectrum.}

\item
\sout{The spectrum is normalised to be the same at $a\sim 0$. So that the $\sigma_8$ of different models are the same.}

\item
Switch from adiabatic initial condition to isocurvature initial condition will change the expression of growth factors (changing the power of H), thus leading to different results.

\item
Introduce interacting between dark energy and dark matter.

\item
Other quantities in cosmology? Can one generalise this method to more calculations?
